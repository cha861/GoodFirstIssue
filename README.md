# GoodFirstIssue

A *Good First Issue* is a beginner-friendly task in open-source projects.  
Itâ€™s usually:
- Simple to understand
- Small in scope
- Great for learning the contribution workflow (clone â†’ code â†’ pull request)

ðŸ‘‰ Look for the good first issue label on GitHub:  
[Browse Good First Issues](https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aopen&type=issues)

Start small, learn the flow, and grow into bigger contributions ðŸš€
